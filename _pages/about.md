Hello! I'm Vidush Singhal, a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am incredibly fortunate and blessed to work under the esteemed guidance of Professor [Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/). My research primarily focuses on compilers, with an emphasis on static analysis to enhance runtime performance of irregular programs, even at the cost of higher compile times. I am particularly interested in automatic parallelization and vectorization to enhance runtime performance and increase resource utilization. Additionally, I am focusing on data layout optimization to improve the spatial locality of irregular programs.
Before joining the Ph.D. program at Purdue University, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Purdue. During my Ph.D. journey, I have had the opportunity to intern at notable organizations such as [Nod.ai](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-10-amd-to-acquire-open-source-ai-software-expert-nod-.html) and [Lawrence Livermore National Labs](https://www.llnl.gov/).
